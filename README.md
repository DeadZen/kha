Final architecture
==================

1. Angular.js on client side
2. SockJS for communication, hence allowing to connect to any remote server
3. Server side
   * Control node
   * Builder node

Control node:
* mnesia for storing projects and builds
* project as a process

Project:
* name
* load config from .travis.yml
* build in place OR
* git clone url
* build instructions (manual or from git/config)

Builder:
* queue manager
* builder as a process

Communications:
* Both project and builder processes will be broadcasting updates with
gproc:bcast/3
* Session process will subscribe to appropriate keys

Notifications
* Notificators will be independent processes which will be getting
broadcasts from builders/processes
